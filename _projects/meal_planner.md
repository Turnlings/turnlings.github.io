This project was atypical in that I went into it intending to see how effective *"vibe coding"* really is. I found that it was very useful at building an MVP, I had a working product in a matter of hours, but as complexity grew it ran into more and more issues. This is where I found it very useful that I had just finished a group project in Rails: [The Rainbow Badge Manager](./rainbows.html) and was currently working on my [Grade Tracker](./grade_tracker.html) over the summer. Having the experience in the technology allowed me to better guide the AI agent, and also make manual changes when required.
