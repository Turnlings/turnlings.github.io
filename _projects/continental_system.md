As this was a piece of coursework we faced heavy restrictions on the use of external libraries and frameworks, because of this I used LibGDX purely for drawing the to screen and getting user inputs. This meant that everything from graph traversal to the UI system were all custom built.

I also had to work on systems to bring real geographical data into the game.
