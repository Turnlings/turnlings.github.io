As this was a piece of coursework we faced heavy restrictions on the use of external libraries and frameworks, because of this I used LibGDX purely for drawing the to screen and getting user inputs. This meant that the UI system (something else here) were all custom built.

I also had to trace the map of Europe and colour each region differently to build my map.
