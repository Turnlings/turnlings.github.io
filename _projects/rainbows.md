Initially a university group project for COM3420 - Software Hut. We were paired with a real client from the local area, in our case a rainbows leader. We successfully planned and built a system for tracking badge achievements using Ruby on Rails.

I personally worked across the system, from design, to implementation to testing.

## Technologies
