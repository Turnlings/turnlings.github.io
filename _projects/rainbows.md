Initially a university group project for *COM3420 - Software Hut*. As a team of 6 we were paired with a real client from the local area, in our case a rainbows leader. We successfully planned and built a system for tracking badge achievements using Ruby on Rails.  

I personally worked across the system, from design, to implementation, to testing.

## Coursework Feedback
Due to teamwork multipliers I achieved a perfect score of **100%** in the coursework component, with praise from our client:
> "The system you have developed is excellent and surpassed my expectations. Well done!"

## Features
- Create and edit badges, assigning them to themes.
- Mark activities as complete and automatically process badge completion.
- Notification system for leaders to track badges to hand out.
- Dynamic page colours to engage users and improve navigation clarity.
- Link Rainbow accounts to parents so they can track progress.
