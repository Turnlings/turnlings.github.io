After learning the language through *C Programming A Modern Approach by K.N.King* I wanted to embark on a larger project to test my knowledge. I wanted a nice and formal project that would let me better understand a core part of computing and in the end I settled on building my own compiler.  

I decided on doing so for my own toy language rather than an existing one so as to also gain experience with building the formal grammars. Also, to put it plainly, I thought it would be fun to be able to say that I made my own programming language.
