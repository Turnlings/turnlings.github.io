After learning the language through *C Programming A Modern Approach by K.N.King* I wanted to embark on a larger project to test my knowledge. I wanted a nice and formal project that would let me better understand a core part of computing and in the end I settled on building my own interpreter.  

I decided on doing so for my own toy language rather than an existing one so as to also gain experience with building the formal grammars. Also, to put it plainly, I thought it would be cool to be able to say that I made my own programming language.

## Language Features

Quokka is a dynamically typed, object-oriented toy programming language. You can see details of the language features and their syntax [in the docs on GitHub](https://github.com/Turnlings/quokka-interpreter/blob/main/docs/FEATURES.md){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
