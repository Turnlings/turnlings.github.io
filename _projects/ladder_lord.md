It has become a bit of a tradition for me to enter the GMTK game jam each year, and this year I wanted to learn from my previous experiences to build something that would see more success. That entailed reducing the scope and focusing more on quality, both with the mechanics and the presentation.  

I built this game in 4 days (with a little extra polish added based on player feedback after submission) and it was good practice not just in the relevant technologies but also in time management.
